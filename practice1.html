                 <b><u>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</b></u> 
                    I strongly believe that perfection is already there in man; inherent in his heart and soul, and education is the medium through which we are able to manifest that perfection. 
                    This century can be credited with having given birth too many ideas, visions, ways of living and working. It can be credited with almost as many revelations of thoughts and practices.
                    “The world is ever changing. An ambition to be a part of and to contribute to this fast changing process, a perpetual urge to learn and quest, a profound desire to translate conception into reality made me opt for a Graduate program” an opportunity through MS at your prestigious university .

                    It was during my final phase of schooling, I met my density- the world of computers. 
                    At this early age, computers have become a means of entertainment like playing video games and generating various mathematical series and patterns through basic programming. 
                    Later I believed that growing field like computers would spell wonders in future. 
                    As I was keenly interested in learning the functioning of electronic goods I thought of selecting a stream which propels me towards reaching the apex of Electronics. 
                    Being versatile and challenging in nature, I cerebrated to gain a cognitive approach on both Electronics and Computers.

            <p align="right">A fascination for Science and keen interest in the ever-growing world of technology motivated me to take up Engineering. I choose to major in Electronics and Communication Engineering at “DRK Institute of Science and Technology” with an intense urge to delve deeper into this challenging field. 
            	This college is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University one of the premier institutions in the India, Where I decided to take on the most interesting & successful career.
As a part of my undergraduate curriculum, I have been exposed to computer organization, microprocessor and interface, computer networks, cellular and mobile communications, embedded systems, wireless communication and networks.
 I have developed a strong command on C programming. 
After acquiring knowledge in micro controllers and previous knowledge in C lead me to make “SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) for Remote Industrial Plant Operation” as my main project.
 This gave me sound knowledge in developing the code. Also, these projects provided me an opportunity to get involved with intricacies of each stage of electrical design. 
By mingling with so many teams and technologies, I have not only grown as electronics engineer, but also as an individual.</p>
